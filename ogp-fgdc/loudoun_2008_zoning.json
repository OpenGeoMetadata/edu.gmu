The data are used extensively for taxation, subdivision review, permitting, and planning.  Although the feature class represents the official zoning map, a determination should be requested from the Zoning Administrator to verify zoning for a particular property.</purpose>\n      <supplinf>The zoning data were compiled from paper zoning maps and zoning records. Official paper zoning maps were maintained beginning in the 1940's through 1987.  In the early 1990's, the paper maps were converted to a digital data.  From 1972 to 1993, zoning was administered in accordance with the 1972 Zoning Ordinance.  In 1993, the County adopted a new zoning ordinance (some properties continue to be administed under the 1972 ordinance).  Official mapping policies were adopted by the Board of Supervisors and were applied to the existing zoning map to complete the current map.\nZoning map amendments (ZMAP applications) are incorporated into the layer upon approval by the Board of Supervisors. The zoning layer has not been updated consistently to reflect ZMAP applications approved since the late 1980's; as approved ZMAP's are brought to the attention of staff the layer is updated appropriately to match the approved concept development plan.  Ordinance data has not been consistently maintained; as discrepancies are discovered the ordinance for a specific zone is corrected.  The zoning data does not include zoning overlay districts, such as LDN, Village Conservation Overlay, floodplain, quarry or mountainside.\nData are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a polygon feature class.  The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN (vertical datum, if applicable, NAVD88), US Survey foot units.\nAs discrepancies between the historical paper maps and the current zoning layer are reported, they are researched and necessary modifications are made to the zoning layer.  Zoning map amendments (ZMAP applications) are incorporated into the layer upon approval by the Board of Supervisors. \nThe zoning layer has not been updated consistently to reflect ZMAP applications approved since the late 1980's; as approved ZMAP's are brought to the attention of staff the layer is updated appropriately to match the approved  concept development plan.
