Ground features are captured and attributed throught the base map maintenance services contract kept by the County. A complete, County wide re mapping project, conducted in two phases, and corresponding updates have yielded the current data set. Phase I, using 2002 Virginia Base Mapping Program (VBMP) digital scanned imagery, and Phase II, using 2004 scanned aerial photography comprise the initial re-map effort. See \"Source_Contribution:\" for extent of Phase areas. The project was completed in 2005 and now undergoes annual updates, with the next one occurring in Spring 2008.\n\nMany annual cycles (2005 to present) of base map update contribute to the development of this layer. OMAGI updates all base map data selectively according to development patterns through stereo compilation and photogrammetry; therefore some feature data may not be current. After years of selective updates based on development, the result was an eastern, suburban part of the County that was updated almost yearly, and a western, rural part of the County that changed little year to year and missed out on the yearly update. As a result, Loudoun County is on a three year update cycle, 1/3rd of the County each year. A generalized map of the update years can be located at OMAGI's documents page under Base maps.\n\nData are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a line feature class.  The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN,  Vertical datum, NAVD88, US Survey foot units.</supplinf>\n    </descript>\n    <timeperd>\n      <timeinfo>\n        <mdattim>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2002</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2004</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2005</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2007</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n        </mdattim>\n      </timeinfo>\n      <current>ground condition</current>\n    </timeperd>\n    <status>\n      <progress>Complete</progress>\n      <update>Annually</update>\n    </status>\n    <spdom>\n      <bounding>\n        <westbc>-77.9635</westbc>\n        <eastbc>-77.3140</eastbc>\n        <northbc>39.3284</northbc>\n        <southbc>38.8369</southbc>\n      </bounding>\n    </spdom>\n    <keywords>\n      <theme>\n        <themekt>Drains</themekt>\n        <themekey>hydrology</themekey>\n        <themekey>surface flow</themekey>\n      </theme>\n      <place>\n        <placekt>Loudoun County</placekt>\n        <placekey>Virginia</placekey>\n        <placekey>VA</placekey>\n      </place>\n    </keywords>\n    <accconst>None, Please see “Distribution Info” for details</accconst>\n    <useconst>Every reasonable effort has been made to assure the accuracy of these data.

Once the random points were visually located on the digital maps a survey crew was dispatched to obtain GPS coordinates of these points.   \n\nFrom the thirty points randomly selected, each point was surveyed using Ashtech Z-12 dual frequency GPS receivers in static mode in a geodetic network format as specified in the FGCS Guidelines. GPS Raw  data was processed with the Ashtech Office Suite (AOS) data reduction software.  This provided the location of the reference data for the accuracy assessment calculations. \n\nUtilizing the sketches, Northing , Easting and Elevations of each of the points were  measured by a stereocompilation technician.  The photogrammetrically determined values are coincident with the final coordinate values in the digital data.\n\nTo complete the NSSDA (National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy) accuracy assessment  the two measurements are compared and a circular root mean square error (RMSE) is calculated.  A spreadsheet was prepared with the measurements and results of these points.\n\nIn Phase 1 ( 2002 ) 25 points in Western Loudoun were considered for Accuracy Assessment. In Phase II ( 2004) 23 points in Eastern Loudoun were considered for Accuracy Assessment.  In Phase III (2005 ) features were compiled to meet ASPRS and NSSDA standards for Class I map at 1:2400 scale, but a rigid accuracy test was not performed. In Phase IV ( 2007 ) 23 points were considered for Accuracy Assessment.\n\nThese calculations were made according to Chapter 3, National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy, Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards, FGDC-STD-007.3-1998: Washington, D.C., Federal Geographic Data Committee, 1998, 28 p. The report can be downloaded from http://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/accuracy/part3/chapter3.

Subsequently, photogrammetrically derived surface drainage was manually connected to GPS-surveyed, known stormwater infrastructure features.  These connection points are the only permissable variations between orthophoto features and vector data.\n\nThe following Stormwater Integration Rules were applied to the compilation of drainage arcs:\n1. Feature = CULVTPT, PIPEIO, and CNTRLDE are used as snapping points in drainage collection.\n2.Stormwater infrastructure data provides guidance for directionality and rule of placement for location of culverts, pipes and headwalls and are snapped to coincident features within 20' radius of proximity.  If no stormwater GPS point exists within 20' radius of proximity,  headwall is represented as best as possible along drain network.\n3. Stormwater data represents transitions from surface to sub-grade drainage.  Sub-grade connections and direction can be determined using stormwater lines.\n4. Snapping was done on  visible surface drain arcs to CULVTPT and/or PIPEIO endpoints along network within 20' radius of proximity.  \n5. Sub-grade, null drains through culverts (DR_Type = 5) are collected per usual, regardless of existence of CULVERT or PIPE line.  \n6. If open channel (DR_Type = 9) is defined and visible along roadside ditch, it is snapped to CULVTPT culvert points and is connected with null drains (DR_Type = 5).\n7. Stormwater lines are used to assist in determination of surface drainage flow direction.  There is a high degree of confidence in accuracy of flow direction as these were collected in the field by surveyors.\n8. Pond Null arcs (DR_Type = 4) are snapped to control devices CNTRLDE if present in wet or dry ponds.\n9. All above-grade, Miscellaneous features (manholes, headwalls/culverts, paved channels) are captured as usual, per contract.  Headwalls (MI_Type = 5) shall be coincident with CULVTPT points, \nwhich connect surface drain arcs (DR_Type = 2, 6, or 9) and sub-grade null arcs (DR_Type = 5)</procdesc>\n        <procdate>2005</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>Loudoun County, VA, OMAGI</cntorg>\n            </cntorgp>\n            <cntpos>Base Map Cartographer</cntpos>\n            <cntaddr>\n              <addrtype/>\n              <address/>\n              <city/>\n              <state/>\n              <postal/>\n            </cntaddr>\n            <cntvoice/>\n          </cntinfo>\n        </proccont>\n      </procstep>\n      <procstep>\n        <procdesc>Each of the Base Map Data Layer coverages in the 27 delivery blocks comprising Phases I and II were loaded into a single Geodatabase Feature Class using ArcGIS Simple Data Loader.

Modifications were done if there was a change in the shape and size of the\n   features.\n5. All the new and updated features were modified and coded as Update_Date= \n    '2007'.\n6. Updated data was checked for edge matching.\n7. DTM was modified in the update area.\n8. Contours were generated, coded and edge matched with the legacy contour data. \n9. Spot Elevation Points were placed. \n10. All clean up tools were run.\n11. Data was exported to PGDB.\n12. QA/ QC Program was run and reported errors were corrected.\n13. Updated data was checked against Orthos for completeness.\n14. All the delivery blocks were merged into a single PGDB.\n15. Legacy PGDB was clipped to Phase 4 delivery boundary.\n16. Updated Data was merged with the Legacy data.\n17. Countywide complete dataset (11 layers) was loaded to enterprise SDE\n      Geodatabase.</procdesc>\n        <procdate>June 2008</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>Loudoun County, VA, OMAGI</cntorg>\n            </cntorgp>\n            <cntpos>Base Map Cartographer</cntpos>\n            <cntaddr>\n              <addrtype/>\n              <address/>\n              <city/>\n              <state/>\n              <postal/>\n            </cntaddr>\n            <cntvoice/>\n          </cntinfo>\n        </proccont>\n      </procstep>\n      <procstep>\n        <procdesc>Dataset copied.from the CD obtained from Loudoun County, VA 2008</procdesc>\n        <srcused>\\\\GIS-VISITOR\\C$\\Documents and Settings\\VISITOR\\Desktop\\GeorgeMason\\pgdb_SDE_5211.mdb</srcused>\n        <procdate>unknown</procdate>\n      </procstep>\n    </lineage>\n  </dataqual>\n  <spdoinfo>\n    <direct>Vector</direct>\n    <ptvctinf>\n      <sdtsterm>\n        <sdtstype>String</sdtstype>\n        <ptvctcnt>96877</ptvctcnt>\n      </sdtsterm>\n    </ptvctinf>\n  </spdoinfo>\n  <spref>\n    <horizsys>\n      <planar>\n        <gridsys>\n          <gridsysn>State Plane Coordinate System 1983</gridsysn>\n          <spcs>\n            <spcszone>4501</spcszone>\n            <lambertc>\n              <stdparll>38.03333333333333</stdparll>\n              <stdparll>39.2</stdparll>\n              <longcm>-78.5</longcm>\n              <latprjo>0.0</latprjo>\n              <feast>11482916.66666666</feast>\n              <fnorth>6561666.666666666</fnorth>\n            </lambertc>\n          </spcs>\n        </gridsys>\n        <planci>\n          <plance>coordinate pair</plance>\n          <coordrep>\n            <absres>0.6096</absres>\n            <ordres>0.6096</ordres>\n          </coordrep>\n          <plandu>survey feet</plandu>\n        </planci>\n      </planar>\n      <geodetic>\n        <horizdn>NAD83_High_Accuracy_Reference_Network</horizdn>\n        <ellips>GRS_1980</ellips>\n        <semiaxis>6378137.0</semiaxis>\n        <denflat>298.257222101</denflat>\n      </geodetic>\n    </horizsys>\n  </spref>\n  <eainfo>\n    <detailed>\n      <enttyp>\n        <enttypl>Drains.shp Attribute Table</enttypl>\n        <enttypd>Table containing attribute information associated with the data set.</enttypd>\n        <enttypds>Producer Defined</enttypds>\n      </enttyp>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>FID</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef>\n        <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n          <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef>Feature geometry.</attrdef>\n        <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n<udom>Coordinates defining the features.</udom>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>OBJECTID</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef/>\n        <attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n<rdom>\n            <rdommin>1</rdommin>\n            <rdommax>96877</rdommax>\n          </rdom>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n  <attrlabl>DR_CLASS</attrlabl>\n<attrdef/>\n<attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs>\n<attrdomv>\n<edom>\n  <edomv>&lt;&lt;

Digitize center lines of streams narrower than 15 ft. Streams wider than 15' are captured as double-line stream polygons in Water Bodies.    \n----------------------------------------------------------------\n#Soil Drain [Type = 3]\n    Captured/Coded by County as an intermittent, upland drainage swale, generally without a visible scour channel.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nCenterline through pond or lake [Type = 4]\n    Non-tangible or null arc that is created in the central location of standing water to show continuity amongst incoming and outgoing streams.  \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nCenterline through bridge or Culvert [Type = 5]\n    Connect with straight line (null arc) from the last visible point.  Nodes shall be placed at headwalls or culverts where visible, not clipped to road casing boundary.  In all cases where a surface drainage features goes underground, use this code regardless of culvert or headwall presence.  \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nCenterline across Paved Ditch  [Type = 6]\n    Digitize null centerline of paved ditch. Cap ends or join cleanly with headwalls, if present. Paved channels will be more heavily associated with stormwater drains and water impoundments. \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nNull Connectors [Type = 7]\n    Null arcs designed to maintain connectivity and directionality of flow by connecting single line streams to double line stream centerlines or one double line stream centerline to another.  \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscontinuous Drain [Type = 8]\n    Drain that is not a continuous above ground feature or fails to connect to further downstream features. \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nCenterline of open (unpaved) channels or ditches [Type = 9]\n    Unpaved, manmade drainage features normally adjacent to roadways. Digitize centerline of any trough greater than 200 feet in length.  \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nCenterline through Potomac River  [Type = 10]\n    Null CL through Potomac River.</eadetcit>\n    </overview>\n  </eainfo>\n  <distinfo>\n    <distrib>\n      <cntinfo>\n        <cntorgp>\n          <cntorg>George Mason University Libraries </cntorg>\n          <cntper>GIS staff in Digital Scholarship Center</cntper>\n        </cntorgp>\n        <cntaddr>\n          <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>\n          <address>4400 University Drive</address>\n          <city>Fairfax</city>\n          <state>VA</state>\n          <postal>22030</postal>\n        </cntaddr>\n        <cntvoice> 703-993-2240</cntvoice>\n        <cntemail>datahelp@gmu.edu</cntemail>\n      </cntinfo>\n    </distrib>\n    <resdesc>Downloadable Data</resdesc>\n    <distliab>Every reasonable effort has been made to assure the accuracy of these data.
