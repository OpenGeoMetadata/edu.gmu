obtained from the CD obtained from Washington DC 2005\nJurisdictions were identified from public records (the three individual websites, legacy GIS data, real property records) and heads-up digitized from the 1995 orthophotographs.\n\nDowntown DC BID provided information for Golden Triangle BID.\n\nA base ArcInfo coverage of correct line work (snapbase.e00) for all DC data was developed after the final delivery of the planimetric street centerlines. The datasets were selected from the snapbase coverage, creating coincident geography with the other DC GIS datasets. When imported into the DC GIS geodatabase the coverages shift 0.01mm since the geodatabase supports only 11 digits of precision, not double precision (16 digits).\n\nAn initial shapefile for each BID was compared to the snapbase linework and a coverage of the correct linework selected out, creating a topologically correct feature. This was built into a polygon.\n\nGeorgetown Partnership BID was created by selecting non-residentially zoned real property owner points to start. Residentially zoned properties are not included in the Georgetown BID. The properties corresponding to these were outlined. This leaves an irregular coverage with holes for those excepted properties.\n\nAttribute data was provided by public records and verified against the BID websites and personal interview.\n\nPlanimetrics were created at a scale of 1:1,000. This means that a well defined feature falls within two feet of true position.\n\nAll DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.\n</procdesc>\n        <procdate>20010806</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>D.C.
