Official paper zoning maps were maintained beginning in the 1940's through 1987. In the early 1990's, the paper maps were converted to a digital data. From 1972 to 1993, zoning was administered in accordance with the 1972 Zoning Ordinance. In 1993, the County adopted a new zoning ordinance (some properties continue to be administered under the 1972 ordinance). Official mapping policies were adopted by the Board of Supervisors and were applied to the existing zoning map to complete the current map. Boundaries generally follow parcel lines, although there are several exceptions. Although the layer represents the official zoning map, a determination should be requested from the Zoning Administrator to verify zoning for a particular property.\nData are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a polygon feature class.  The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN (vertical datum, if applicable, NAVD88), US Survey foot units.</supplinf>\n    </descript>\n    <timeperd>\n      <timeinfo>\n        <sngdate>\n          <caldate>2003</caldate>\n        </sngdate>\n      </timeinfo>\n      <current>publication date</current>\n    </timeperd>\n    <status>\n      <progress>Complete</progress>\n      <update>As needed</update>\n    </status>\n    <spdom>\n      <bounding>\n        <westbc>-77.9634</westbc>\n        <eastbc>-77.3240</eastbc>\n        <northbc>39.3262</northbc>\n        <southbc>38.8443</southbc>\n      </bounding>\n    </spdom>\n    <keywords>\n      <theme>\n        <themekt>Boundaries</themekt>\n        <themekey>Historic</themekey>\n        <themekey>Zoning</themekey>\n      </theme>\n      <place>\n        <placekt>Loudon County</placekt>\n        <placekey>Virginia</placekey>\n        <placekey>VA</placekey>\n      </place>\n    </keywords>\n    <accconst>None, Please see “Distribution Info” for details</accconst>\n    <useconst>Every reasonable effort has been made to assure the accuracy of these data.

Layers with both polygon and arc feature classes were processed with the Arc commands, MAPJOIN and DISSOLVE. Arc feature classes alone were processed with the Arc commands, APPEND and DISSOLVE. Layers with both arc and point feature classes and point feature classes alone were processed with the Arc command, APPEND.  When used, the Arc command, DISSOLVE, was given with the &lt;#all&gt; option.\n\nAll coverages were then reprojected to HARN 83 using the following .prj file specifications: \nINPUT\nPROJECTION STATEPLANE\nUNITS FEET\nZONE 5551\nDATUM NAD27 NADCON\nPARAMETERS\nOUTPUT\nPROJECTION STATEPLANE\nUNITS FEET\nFIPSZONE 4501\nDATUM HPGN NADCON\nPARAMETERS END\n\t\t\t   \nThis dataset was then converted to a feature class in a geodatabase in ArcSDE.</procdesc>\n        <procdate>2004</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>Loudoun County, VA, Office of Mapping and Geographic Information (OMAGI)</cntorg>\n            </cntorgp>\n            <cntpos>GIS Systems Analyst</cntpos>\n            <cntaddr>\n              <addrtype/>\n              <address/>\n              <city/>\n              <state/>\n              <postal/>\n            </cntaddr>\n            <cntvoice/>\n          </cntinfo>\n        </proccont>\n      </procstep>\n      <procstep>\n        <procdesc>Dataset copied from the CD obtained from Loudoun County, VA in 2008</procdesc>\n        <srcused>\\\\GIS-VISITOR\\C$\\Documents and Settings\\VISITOR\\Desktop\\GeorgeMason\\pgdb_SDE_5211.mdb</srcused>\n        <procdate>Unknown</procdate>\n      </procstep>\n    </lineage>\n  </dataqual>\n  <spdoinfo>\n    <direct>Vector</direct>\n    <ptvctinf>\n      <sdtsterm>\n        <sdtstype>G-polygon</sdtstype>\n        <ptvctcnt>696</ptvctcnt>\n      </sdtsterm>\n    </ptvctinf>\n  </spdoinfo>\n  <spref>\n    <horizsys>\n      <planar>\n        <gridsys>\n          <gridsysn>State Plane Coordinate System 1983</gridsysn>\n          <spcs>\n            <spcszone>4501</spcszone>\n            <lambertc>\n              <stdparll>38.03333333333333</stdparll>\n              <stdparll>39.2</stdparll>\n              <longcm>-78.5</longcm>\n              <latprjo>0.0</latprjo>\n              <feast>11482916.66666666</feast>\n              <fnorth>6561666.666666666</fnorth>\n            </lambertc>\n          </spcs>\n        </gridsys>\n        <planci>\n          <plance>coordinate pair</plance>\n          <coordrep>\n            <absres>0.6096</absres>\n            <ordres>0.6096</ordres>\n          </coordrep>\n          <plandu>survey feet</plandu>\n        </planci>\n      </planar>\n      <geodetic>\n        <horizdn>NAD83_High_Accuracy_Reference_Network</horizdn>\n        <ellips>GRS_1980</ellips>\n        <semiaxis>6378137.0</semiaxis>\n        <denflat>298.257222101</denflat>\n      </geodetic>\n    </horizsys>\n  </spref>\n  <eainfo>\n    <detailed>\n      <enttyp>\n        <enttypl>Hzoning.shp Attribute Table</enttypl>\n        <enttypd>Table containing attribute information associated with the data set.</enttypd>\n        <enttypds>Producer Defined</enttypds>\n      </enttyp>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>FID</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef>\n        <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n          <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef>Feature geometry.</attrdef>\n        <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n<udom>Coordinates defining the features.</udom>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>OBJECTID</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef/>\n        <attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n<rdom>\n            <rdommin>1</rdommin>\n            <rdommax>696</rdommax>\n          </rdom>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>HZ_ZONE</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef/>\n        <attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n<udom/>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n  <attrlabl>HZ_ORDINAN</attrlabl>\n<attrdef/>\n<attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs>\n<attrdomv>\n<edom>\n  <edomv>&lt;&lt;
