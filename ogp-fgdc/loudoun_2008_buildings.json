Ground features are captured and attributed throught the base map maintenance services contract kept by the County. A complete, Countywide remapping project, conducted in two phases, and corresponding updates have yielded the current data set.  Phase I, using 2002 Virginia Base Mapping Program (VBMP) digital scanned imagery, and Phase II, using 2004 scanned aerial photography comprise the initial re-map effort.  See \"Source_Contribution:\" for extent of Phase areas.  The project was completed in 2005 and now undergoes annual updates, with the next one occurring in Spring 2008. \n\nMany annual cycles (2005 to present) of base map update contribute to the development of this layer.  OMAGI updates all base map data selectively according to development patterns through stereocompilation and photogrammetry; therefore some feature data may not be current.  After years of selective updates based on development, the result was an eastern, suburban part of the County that was updated almost yearly, and a western, rural part of the County little year to year and missed out on the yearly update.  As a result, Loudoun County is on a three year update cycle, 1/3rd of the County each year. A generalized map of the update years can be located at OMAGI's documents page under Basemaps.  \n \nData are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a polygon feature class.  The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum  NAVD88 , US Survey foot units.</supplinf>\n    </descript>\n    <timeperd>\n      <timeinfo>\n        <mdattim>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2002</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2004</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2005</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2007</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n        </mdattim>\n      </timeinfo>\n      <current>ground condition</current>\n    </timeperd>\n    <status>\n      <progress>Complete</progress>\n      <update>Annually</update>\n    </status>\n    <spdom>\n      <bounding>\n        <westbc>-77.9631</westbc>\n        <eastbc>-77.3216</eastbc>\n        <northbc>39.3222</northbc>\n        <southbc>38.8370</southbc>\n      </bounding>\n    </spdom>\n    <keywords>\n      <theme>\n        <themekt>Location,Buildings</themekt>\n        <themekey>building</themekey>\n        <themekey>structure</themekey>\n      </theme>\n      <place>\n        <placekt>Loudoun County</placekt>\n        <placekey>Virginia</placekey>\n        <placekey>VA</placekey>\n      </place>\n    </keywords>\n    <accconst>none</accconst>\n    <useconst>Chapter 54.1-402 of the Code of Virginia.\n     \"Any determination of topography or contours, or any depiction of physical improvements, property lines or boundaries is for general information only and shall not be used for the design, modification, or construction of improvements to real property or for flood plain determination.\"\n     \n       Every reasonable effort has been made to assure the accuracy of these data.

Once the random points were visually located on the digital maps a survey crew was dispatched to obtain GPS coordinates of these points.   \n\nFrom the thirty points randomly selected, each point was surveyed using Ashtech Z-12 dual frequency GPS receivers in static mode in a geodetic network format as specified in the FGCS Guidelines. GPS Raw  data was processed with the Ashtech Office Suite (AOS) data reduction software.  This provided the location of the reference data for the accuracy assessment calculations. \n\nUtilizing the sketches, Northing , Easting and Elevations of each of the points were  measured by a stereocompilation technician.  The photogrammetrically determined values are coincident with the final coordinate values in the digital data.\n\nTo complete the NSSDA (National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy) accuracy assessment  the two measurements are compared and a circular root mean square error (RMSE) is calculated.  A spreadsheet was prepared with the measurements and results of these points.\n\nIn Phase 1 ( 2002 ) 25 points in Western Loudoun were considered for Accuracy Assessment. In Phase II ( 2004) 23 points in Eastern Loudoun were considered for Accuracy Assessment.  In Phase III (2005 ) features were compiled to meet ASPRS and NSSDA standards for Class I map at 1:2400 scale, but a rigid accuracy test was not performed. In Phase IV ( 2007 ) 23 points were considered for Accuracy Assessment.\n\nThese calculations were made according to Chapter 3, National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy, Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards, FGDC-STD-007.3-1998: Washington, D.C., Federal Geographic Data Committee, 1998, 28 p.
