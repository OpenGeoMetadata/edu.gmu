Ground features are captured and attributed throught the base map maintenance services contract kept by the County. A complete, County wide re mapping project, conducted in two phases, and corresponding updates have yielded the current data set. Phase I, using 2002 Virginia Base Mapping Program (VBMP) digital scanned imagery, and Phase II, using 2004 scanned aerial photography comprise the initial re-map effort. See \"Source_Contribution:\" for extent of Phase areas. The project was completed in 2005 and now undergoes annual updates, with the next one occurring in Spring 2008.\n    \nMany annual cycles (2005 to present) of base map update contribute to the development of this layer. OMAGI updates all base map data selectively according to development patterns through stereo compilation and photogrammetry; therefore some feature data may not be current. After years of selective updates based on development, the result was an eastern, suburban part of the County that was updated almost yearly, and a western, rural part of the County little that changed little year to year and missed out on the yearly update. As a result, Loudoun County is on a three year update cycle, 1/3rd of the County each year. A generalized map of the update years can be located at OMAGI's documents page under Base maps.\nData are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a polygon feature class.  The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN, Vertical datum, NAVD88, US Survey foot units.</supplinf>\n    </descript>\n    <timeperd>\n      <timeinfo>\n        <mdattim>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2002</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2004</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2005</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n          <sngdate>\n            <caldate>March 2007</caldate>\n          </sngdate>\n        </mdattim>\n      </timeinfo>\n      <current>ground condition</current>\n    </timeperd>\n    <status>\n      <progress>Complete</progress>\n      <update>Annually</update>\n    </status>\n    <spdom>\n      <bounding>\n        <westbc>-77.9430</westbc>\n        <eastbc>-77.3248</eastbc>\n        <northbc>39.3204</northbc>\n        <southbc>38.8783</southbc>\n      </bounding>\n    </spdom>\n    <keywords>\n      <theme>\n        <themekt>Geodetic</themekt>\n        <themekey>Forest control points</themekey>\n        <themekey/>\n      </theme>\n      <place>\n        <placekt>Loudoun County</placekt>\n        <placekey>Virginia</placekey>\n        <placekey>VA</placekey>\n      </place>\n    </keywords>\n    <accconst>None, Please see “Distribution Info” for details</accconst>\n    <useconst>These data were generated for use by Loudoun County and are available to the public.
