The  datasets were selected using the above shapefile from the snapbase coverage, creating coincident geography with the other DC GIS datasets. These planimetric features were built as lines and used to create polygons.\n\nThis polygon was generated from the AOCLn feature.\nPlanimetrics were created at a scale of 1:1,000. This means that a well defined feature falls within two feet of true position.\n\nAll DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.\n</procdesc>\n        <procdate>20010806</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>D.C.
