Layers with both arc and point feature classes and point feature classes alone were processed with the Arc command, APPEND.  When used, the arc command, DISSOLVE, was given with the &lt;#all&gt; option.\n        All coverages were then reprojected to HARN83 using the following .prj file            specifications:\n        INPUT\n        PROJECTION STATEPLANE\n        UNITS FEET\n        ZONE 5551\n        DATUM NAD27 NADCON\n        PARAMETERS\n        OUTPUT\n        PROJECTION STATEPLANE\n        UNITS FEET\n        FIPSZONE 4501\n        DATUM HPGN NADCON\n        PARAMETERS END\n\n        The dataset was then converted to a feature class in a geodatabase in ArcSDE.</procdesc>\n        <procdate>2004</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>Loudoun County, VA, Office of Mapping and Geographic Information (OMAGI)</cntorg>\n            </cntorgp>\n            <cntpos>GIS Analyst</cntpos>\n            <cntaddr>\n              <addrtype/>\n              <address/>\n              <city/>\n              <state/>\n              <postal/>\n            </cntaddr>\n            <cntvoice/>\n          </cntinfo>\n        </proccont>\n      </procstep>\n      <procstep>\n        <procdesc>This school zone layer has the potential for new school zones and corresponding boundary adjustments before the beginning of the current school year.
