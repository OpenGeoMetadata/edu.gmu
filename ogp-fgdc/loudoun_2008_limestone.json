The terrain is also characterized by the presence of certain natural features, such as sinkholes and rock outcrops.  Thus, development on Karst terrain has a direct correlation to the potential for collapse and ground slippage and the susceptibility of groundwater and surface water pollution, and spring contamination, posing serious risks to public health, safety and welfare.  The provisions of Section 4-1900 of the Revised 1993 Zoning Ordinance are intended to regulate land use and development in areas underlain by limestone and in areas with Karst features and terrain as shown on the official Limestone Conglomerate Overlay District Map of Loudoun County.</purpose>\n      <supplinf>Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a polygon feature class.
