The MAR contains more addresses than are active so the following informaiton will help users determine the current addresses for the District. What do the different statuses in the address table mean? - ACTIVE - addresses for buildings which are standing. The overwhelming majority of addresses have the 'ACTIVE' status. - RECOMMENDED - addresses which have been recommended (suggested) by a DC GIS employee for approval by DCRA. - ASSIGNED - addresses which have been assigned (approved) by DCRA, but whose buildings have not yet been constructed. - RETIRE - addresses for buildings that have been demolished or for addresses which represented space which has since been occupied by a different address (example: a retail store closing and being taken over by a neighboring store which knocks the wall down) - TEMPORARY - addresses which will exist for a relatively short period of time. Construction trailers, special event tents may be given this TEMPORARY designation. - MISTAKE - addresses which are incorrect. These MISTAKE addresses are automatically deleted each and every evening. These MISTAKE addresses are due to incorrect data being entered using the MAR Maintenance Tool.</supplinf>\n    </descript>\n    <timeperd>\n      <timeinfo>\n        <sngdate>\n          <caldate>2020</caldate>\n        </sngdate>\n      </timeinfo>\n      <current>publication date</current>\n    </timeperd>\n    <status>\n      <progress>Complete</progress>\n      <update>Weekly</update>\n    </status>\n    <spdom>\n      <bounding>\n        <westbc>-77.1143</westbc>\n        <eastbc>-76.9096</eastbc>\n        <northbc>38.9955</northbc>\n        <southbc>38.8122</southbc>\n      </bounding>\n    </spdom>\n    <keywords>\n      <theme>\n        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>\n        <themekey>location</themekey>\n      </theme>\n      <theme>\n        <themekt>None</themekt>\n        <themekey>Addresspts</themekey>\n        <themekey>Building Number</themekey>\n        <themekey>Street Address</themekey>\n        <themekey>Address</themekey>\n        <themekey>Street Number</themekey>\n        <themekey>Quadrant</themekey>\n        <themekey>Address Location</themekey>\n        <themekey>Address Point</themekey>\n        <themekey>location</themekey>\n        <themekey>Street Type</themekey>\n      </theme>\n      <place>\n        <placekt>None</placekt>\n        <placekey>DCGIS</placekey>\n        <placekey>DC</placekey>\n        <placekey>DC GIS</placekey>\n        <placekey>Washington</placekey>\n        <placekey>D.C.</placekey>\n        <placekey>District of Columbia</placekey>\n      </place>\n    </keywords>\n    <accconst>None</accconst>\n    <useconst>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</useconst>\n    <ptcontac>\n      <cntinfo>\n        <cntorgp>\n          <cntorg>D.C.

In process of validation by source and/or responsible agency. OCTO GIS performed several first round QA/QC to check the completeness and accuracy of the address points. 1. Quad Test - Test the Quadrant field in the data against the DC quad geography to see which address points are located in the wrong quadrant. 2. Ward Test - Test the Ward field in the data against the Ward geography to see which address points are located in the wrong ward. 3. Street Name Test - Select address points on street name and, based on clustering, see which address points do not fall along the selected street corridors. This test was performed for all A to W streets, 1st to 63rd streets, all state named avenues, most major roads, and random local streets. 4. Address Number Test - Select address points by unit block and, based on clustering, to check which address points do not fall along selected address range corridors. 5. Water Test - Select which address points intersect waterbodies. 6. Building Test - Since most address points should occur in buildings, select points that do not intersect a building. This test just flags points for further review. 7. Road Test - Select where address points intersect road polygons. Since dated planimetrics were used in the test, the results mostly flagged data for further research. OCTO GIS also performed a detailed visual inspection of the city. This identified areas missing address points. OCTO GIS provided a report detailing the findings of the tests and a map showing the coded points and areas of omission. Upon final delivery of the data, OCTO GIS performed several QA/QC to check the completeness and accuracy of the address points. 1. Address Identifier Check - Perform a summation on the address key field (ADDRESS_ID) and review for uniqueness and null values. 2. Address Range Check - Check for address numbers outside of the acceptable DC range, 1 through 8500. 3. Address Suffix Check - Check Address suffix for discrepancies. 4. Address Test - Compare the street name to the DDOT street list. 5. Address Test - Compare the street name and type to the DDOT street list. 6. Address Test - Compare the street name, type, and quad to the DDOT street list. 7. Quad Test - Test the Quadrant field in the data against the DC quad geography to see which address points are located in the wrong quadrant. From these tests, several records were flagged with incorrect values or locations. These errors were fixed before OCTO generated a new address point layer.</attraccr>\n    </attracc>\n    <logic>Validated by source and/or responsible agency</logic>\n    <complete>Currently, the addresspts layer representing MAR ( Master Address Repository) addresses has 135,480 address. The file is approximately 99% complete and contains locations with full addresses ( 900 Pennsylvania Avenue NW) and partial addresses (Washington Monument).

On the second pass, it was found that the OwnerPts were not always on buildings and therefore had to be moved to the building centroids. Wherever building footprints did not exist in the building layer but the building appeared on the ortho, a visual center of the building on the ortho was used.</horizpar>\n      </horizpa>\n

Addresses of each dataset were parsed, validated, and verified against the initial Master Address Table (MAT) created using the OTR database. All unverified and invalid addresses were manually reviewed. Addresses, which were invalid due to missing address components, were further examined in the manual process. The manual review was based on the following information: Street Name, Street Range, Building Polygons, Property Scanned Images, and the Ortho. MAR addresses were also tested against the Mobile data as Mobile addresses were verified by field verification and thus more accurate. The manual review was based on the 1999 planimetric data provided by OCTO, predominantly on buildings and street centerlines. Therefore, accuracy of addresses depended somewhat on the accuracy and currentness of the planimetric data. As a result, manual review was limited by the planimetric data and the owner point X,Y coordinates provided by OCTO. The address points were primarily created from the 'Ownerpoints' database from the DC Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) given to ARCBridge by DC OCTO. OTR: 172,470 Phase I: The 'Premiseadd' field was parsed to separate the address components. Addresses with the above mentioned components were treated as complete address. Staff checked whether the X,Y values of the complete addresses existed. If a good address didn't have X,Y values, then it was added. Addresses were manually reviewed to check the address location. Addresses, whose street number, name, and location matched, were treated as complete and added to MAR. Phase II: The addresses from the 'Address 2' field were processed, as while reviewing a number of addresses in the 'Address2' field appear correct. Staff checked whether the X,Y values of the complete addresses existed. If a good address didn't have X,Y values, then it was added. Addresses were manually reviewed to check the address location. Addresses, whose street number, name, and location matched, were treated as complete and added to MAR. Phase III: The remaining addresses that either had missing component or didn't appear correct were manually reviewed. Addresses components were then reviewed. For example: If the street type was missing or wrong and all the other components like street name, number, and location were correct, then the street type was added or changed. Staff checked whether the X,Y values of the complete addresses exist or not. If a good address didn't have X,Y values, then it was added. These modified addresses were added to the MAR. Phase IV: The remaining addresses that could not be verified, didn't appear correct, or were ambiguous were moved into the comment table. WASA: 132,868 WASA addresses didn't have X,Y values, therefore the addresses were geocoded to add X,Y coordinates. Phase I: The 'Address' field was parsed to separate the address components. Addresses with the above mentioned components were treated as complete addresses. Staff checked whether X,Y values of the complete addresses existed. If any good address didn't have XY values then it was added. Addresses were manually reviewed to check the address location. Addresses, whose street number, name &amp; location matched, were treated as good and complete and added to MAR. Phase II. The remaining addresses that either had a missing component or didn't appear correct were manually reviewed. Addresses components were then reviewed. For example: If the street type was missing or wrong and all the other components like street name, number, and location were correct, then the street type was added or changed. Staff checked whether X,Y values of the complete addresses existed. If a good address didn't have X,Y values, then it was added. These modified addresses were then added to the MAR. Phase III. Addresses that could not be verified, didn't appear correct, or were ambiguous were moved to the comment table. MPD: 269,350 Phase I: The 'Address' field was parsed to separate the address components. Addresses with the above mentioned components were treated as complete addresses. Staff checked whether the X,Y values of the complete addresses existed. If a good address didn't have XY values, then it was added. Addresses were manually reviewed to check their location. Addresses, whose street number, name, and location matched, were treated as complete and added to MAR. Phase II: The remaining Addresses that either contained a missing component or didn't appear correct were manually reviewed. Addresses components were then reviewed. For example: If the street type was missing or wrong and all the other components like street name, number, and location were correct, then the street type was added or changed. Staff checked whether the X,Y values of the complete addresses existed. If a good address didn't have X,Y values, then it was added. These modified addresses were added to the MAR. Phase III: Addresses that couldn't be verified, didn't appear correct, or were ambiguous were moved to the comment table. Numerous MPD addresses were moved to the comments table as most of them appeared theoretical, such as a full address with no associated building. OTR- Mobile Video data: 156,527 Mobile addresses were created and verified at the physical location of the address, thus strengthening the validity of the attribution. Most other source information was generated and verified using manual in-house procedures. Mobile Video addresses were manually reviewed to check the address locations. Addresses, whose street number, name, and location matched, were treated as valid. The remaining addresses were moved to the comments table. Addresses with comments were manually reviewed. Addresses components were reviewed, for example: If type was missing or wrong and all the other components like street name, number &amp; location were correct then type was added/changed. These modified correct addresses were moved out of the Comment table and added to the valid Mobile Video address table. Many of the same procedures were run on the remaining source datasets: DMV - Registered Vehicles - 53,507 DMV - Drivers License: - 140,595 D&amp;B - Business: - 38,625 MCC - EMA - 195,857 MPD - Street File - 128,699 OTR- Property Owners - 129,800 OTR- Property Inventory - 161,408 BOEE- Registered Voters - 318,318 DOH - 201,796 FEMS - E 911 - 142,407 DDOT- Street Centerline - 33,291 DCRA - New Addresses - 151 Total Address Records Reviewed - 2,275,669 Working with Unverified Addresses: Phase I: The full address field of each dataset was parsed to separate the address components using the MDS Tool. Addresses with the all the required components were treated as complete addresses. All addresses validated and verified. All unverified addresses were manually reviewed to create address points. Unverified addresses were geocoded if the dataset did not have X, Y coordinates. Addresses, whose street number, name, and location matched, were treated as complete and added to MAR. Good addresses that the analyst was unable to verify were placed in the comments table. Phase II: Addresses that either had missing components or didn't appear correct were manually reviewed. Addresses components were then reviewed. For example, if the streey type was missing or incorrect and all other components, like street name, number, and location, were correct, then the streey type of the address location type was added or changed. If the street number was missing or incorrect, then the street number range and adjacent building numbers were used to correct or add the street number. If street name was missing or incorrect, then the street name at the address point location was identified and added or modified. If the quad was missing or incorrect, then the quad at the address point location was identified and added or modified. If any address was complete but the address point was at the wrong location, then staff identified the related street name and range from the street centerlines and moved theaddress point to the correct location manually. Then, the moved address points' X,Y values were updated. These modified correct addresses were added to the MAR. Phase III. Staff then completed the comments table. Addresses that couldn't be verified, didn't appear correct, or were ambiguous were moved to the comment table. It contains all of the reject addresses from the 15 source datasets.

The address view pulls data from: 1.) DC MAR for address key; 2.) DDOT Street Spatial Database for street information; and 3.) OCTO GIS enterprise geodatabase for square, suffix, and lot (SSL). Staff imported this file into the GIS enterprise geodatabase and created an event theme using the x,y coordinates. The event theme was converted to a feature class. Staff then overlayed the feature class with the following layers: - 2002 ANC - 2002 Ward - Police Service Area - Police District - Police Regional Operations Command - Zip Code - Neighborhood - Neighborhood Cluster - 2002 SMD - Voting Precinct - Census Tract Staff then regenerated the address view to capture SSL values.
