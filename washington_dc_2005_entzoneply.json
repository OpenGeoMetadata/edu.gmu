The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 includes amendments to the District of Columbia Home Rule Charter which grant the District government broad authority to issue taxable and tax-exempt revenue bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and renovation of a wide array of capital projects owned by private enterprises and non-profit institutions. Provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA) complement these expanded financing powers by establishing the District of Columbia \"Enterprise Zone\" (EZ).\n\nFederal incentives designed to tap the investment and employment potential of the EZ include three types of wage credits, an additional expensing allowance, a zero federal capital gains tax rate on certain investments and tax-exempt bond financing.\n\nEnterprise Zone Resources:\n\nFor more information about Enterprise Zone incentives, visit, the Incentives section of the DC Marketing Center's website.\n\nTo determine whether a location is within the DC Enterprise Zone, contact the DC Revenue Bond Program\n(202) 727-6365 or (202) 727-0377 or visit\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development's EZ/EC locator at http://www.hud.gov/ezec/locator.\n\nFor a copy of the Internal Revenue Service publication 954, Tax Incentives for Empowerment Zones and Other Distressed Communities, visit the publications section of the IRS website: http://www.irs.gov/forms_pubs/.\nhttp://dcbiz.dc.gov/info/rb.shtm\nDC Enterprise Zone\n\nBetween January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2002, District of Columbia Enterprise Zone (DC Zone) Businesses are entitled to claim more than $1.2 billion of federal tax credits, deductions, exemptions and exclusions. These unique tax benefits are available to businesses, trade associations, non-profit institutions, and individuals that meet each of the following criteria:\n\nThe sole trade or business of the corporation, limited liability company or partnership is the active conduct of a \"qualified business\" (this requirement applies to activities of non-profit and not-for-profit entities, but not sole proprietorships);\nAt least 50 percent of business income is derived from the active conduct of a trade or business within the DC Zone;\nA substantial portion of the tangible property used in the business is within the DC Zone;\nA substantial portion of the intangible property is used in the active conduct of such business;\nA substantial portion of services performed for the business by its employees is performed in the DC Zone; and\nLess than five percent of the average of the aggregate unadjusted bases of the property of the business is attributable to (a) certain financial property such as debts, partnership interests, stock and annuities, or (b) collectibles not held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of an active trade or business.\nBusinesses that meet the foregoing requirements (EZ Businesses) may be eligible to obtain:\n\nUp to $15 million of tax-exempt financing of the depreciable tangible property owned by each qualified entity;\nAn additional $20,000 expensing allowance for business machinery and equipment;\nThree types of employment tax credits; and\nZero federal capital gains tax rate on cash investments in certain businesses located in census tracts with poverty rates 10 percent and higher.\nEnterprise Zone Description\nThe District of Columbia Enterprise Zone consists primarily of all census tracts with 20 percent and higher poverty rates. These tracts represent more than one-third (65) of the District's 193 census tracts and cover about half of the District's developable land area. An additional 57 census tracts with poverty rates between 10 percent and 20 percent also comprise the DC Zone for purposes of the federal capital gains tax exclusion. The new DC Zone incorporates the former District \"enterprise community\" and is treated as an \"Empowerment Zone\" for purposes of most business tax incentives.</supplinf>\n    </descript>\n    <timeperd>\n      <timeinfo>\n        <sngdate>\n          <caldate>06/10/2002</caldate>\n        </sngdate>\n      </timeinfo>\n      <current>publication date</current>\n    </timeperd>\n    <status>\n      <progress>Complete</progress>\n      <update>As needed</update>\n    </status>\n    <spdom>\n      <bounding>\n        <westbc>-77.0827</westbc>\n        <eastbc>-76.9092</eastbc>\n        <northbc>38.9631</northbc>\n        <southbc>38.7917</southbc>\n      </bounding>\n    </spdom>\n    <keywords>\n      <theme>\n        <themekt>Government jurisdictions</themekt>\n        <themekey>Economic incentive zones</themekey>\n        <themekey>Census tracts</themekey>\n        <themekey>Tracts</themekey>\n        <themekey>Census</themekey>\n      </theme>\n      <place>\n        <placekt>Washington, DC</placekt>\n        <placekey>District of Columbia</placekey>\n        <placekey>DC</placekey>\n      </place>\n    </keywords>\n    <accconst>Contact OCTO GIS.

The polygon was created by attributing the 1990 census tracts with appropriate poverty figures and selecting those with over 10% poverty rate.  Census tracts were identified from public records (US Census Bureau and DC Office of Planning) and initially created selecting street arcs from the WGIS planimetric Street centerlines and, where necessary, heads-up digitized from the 1995 orthophotographs. A base ArcInfo coverage of correct line work (snapbase.e00) for all DC data was developed after the final delivery of the planimetric street centerlines. The datasets were selected from the snapbase coverage, creating coincident geography with the other DC GIS datasets.\n\nAttribute data was provided by United States Census Bureau and the DC Office of Planning and the DC Marketing Center website, &lt;http://www.dcchamber.org/Business/in_dc.asp?whatpage=in&gt; ).\n\nPlanimetrics were created at a scale of 1:1,000. This means that a well defined feature falls within two feet of true position.\n\nAll DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.</procdesc>\n        <procdate>20010806</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>D.C.
