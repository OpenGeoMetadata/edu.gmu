This was the incident in which a toxic gas, methyl isocyanate, escaped from an industrial plant and killed or injured 2,000 - 5,000 people. Title III of SARA, also known as the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, establishes the public's right to know what chemicals are stored in their\ncommunities. It also requires state and local governments to establish local committees to identify hazardous materials and to plan for responding to  reeases of the materials.\n\nThe Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 lso known as SARA Title III, brings industry, government and the general public together to address emergency planning for accidental chemical releases. The emergency planning aspect requires communities to prepare for hazardous chemical releases through emergency planning. This provides essential information for emergency responders and creates a database of hazardous chemical storage information for the community. The community right-to-know aspect increases public awareness of chemical hazards in their community and allows the public and local governments to obtain information about these chemical hazards.</supplinf>\n    </descript>\n    <timeperd>\n      <timeinfo>\n        <sngdate>\n          <caldate>07/12/05</caldate>\n        </sngdate>\n      </timeinfo>\n      <current>publication date</current>\n    </timeperd>\n    <status>\n      <progress>In work</progress>\n      <update>As needed</update>\n    </status>\n    <spdom>\n      <bounding>\n        <westbc>-77.1112</westbc>\n        <eastbc>-76.9589</eastbc>\n        <northbc>38.9659</northbc>\n        <southbc>38.8174</southbc>\n      </bounding>\n    </spdom>\n    <keywords>\n      <theme>\n        <themekt>none</themekt>\n        <themekey>Hazardous</themekey>\n        <themekey/>\n        <themekey>Chemical</themekey>\n        <themekey>Storage Tank</themekey>\n        <themekey>Above Ground</themekey>\n        <themekey>Environment</themekey>\n      </theme>\n      <place>\n        <placekt>Washington, DC</placekt>\n        <placekey>District of Columbia</placekey>\n        <placekey>DC</placekey>\n      </place>\n    </keywords>\n    <accconst>Contact OCTO GIS.

In order to properly bring the data into ArcGIS and geocode, first the data was copied into a Microsoft Excel Sheet.  A simple copy/paste function of the data was insufficient and required added organization of the data.  Added organization included removing previous formats and concatenating cells.\n\nOnce complete, the next step was to save the Excel Sheet as a DBF table and bring the data into ArcGIS, where a \"US One Address\" address locator (using Master Address Repository) was used to geocoded the data.  Any unmatched addresses were then geocoded against the District's Street Center Line Inventory.\n\nMuch of the original address information was incorrectly entered and had to be altered in the Standardized Addresses in order to match with a location.
