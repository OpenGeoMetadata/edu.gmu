    "This layer contains data defining the exterior boundaries of land under common ownership, typically within condominium properties within Fairfax County, Virginia.  The common area layer was created to depict these areas of land that do not actually have a parcel identification numbers.  These areas of land are owned by a group of properties that lie within the common area.  Information portrayed on this layer was initially derived from the ink-on-mylar property maps maintained by the County since the early 1960s."
