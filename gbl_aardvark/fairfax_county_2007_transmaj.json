    "This layer contains the major transportation areas that have been captured through various processes.  The original data in this layer was captured during the 1997-2000 data conversion effort for Fairfax County.  The major transportation areas were captured using stereo models.  Since then the GIS office has captured major transportation areas from ortho photography by performing heads up digitizing.  Prior to receiving the ortho photography, site plans are used to capture the planned major transportation areas.  These different sources of the major transportation areas are indicated within the major transportation areas attributes."
