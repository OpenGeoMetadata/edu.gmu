    "\n    The Civic personal geodatabase delineates the areas of Arlington County\n    included in civic associations, and identifies each area by name. The\n    CIVIC_BUFFER feature class delineates the same areas except as a \u201cbuffered\u201d\n    line; that is, a band of color (or fill pattern) along the perimeter delineates each\n    civic association, rather than showing the entire polygon. Annotation identifies\n    the name of each association.\n   "
