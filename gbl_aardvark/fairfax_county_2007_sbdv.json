    "This layer contains data defining the exterior boundaries of subdivided land within Fairfax County, Virginia.  The Subdivision layer was created to depict subdivided land areas defined by recorded documents (plats) for the County of Fairfax.  The polygons portrayed on this layer define the second portion of the County's Parcel Identification Numbering system (Map / Subdivision / Block / Parcel).  Information portrayed on this layer was initially derived from the ink-on-mylar property maps maintained by the County since the early 1960s."
