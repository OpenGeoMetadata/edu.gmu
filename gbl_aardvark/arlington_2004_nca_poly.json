    "\n    This polygon layer represents the boundary of neighborhood conservation areas (NCA).\n\n    The Neighborhood Conservation Area geodatabase consists of three feature\n    classes, NCA_ARC, NCA_POLY and NCA_BUFFER. The NCA feature classes\n    delineate the areas of Arlington County where a conservation area have been\n    defined, and denotes those with County-approved conservation plans.\n    Annotation identifies the areas by name. The NCA_BUFFER feature class also\n    shows the conservation areas, but uses a \u201cbuffered\u201d line, or a band of color (or\n    fill pattern) inside the perimeter.\n   "
