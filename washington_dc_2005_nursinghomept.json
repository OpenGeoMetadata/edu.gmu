From this, staff determine the appropriate source and location for each layer, and assess the effort needed to get it.  \n\nSome layers, already part of the DC Atlas, are incorporated into the data store.  For DC agency data, agency liaisons ask DC personnel about data availability and acquisition.  For third-party data, OCTO-GIS evaluates options and either finds alternatives, purchases, or licenses the data.  In some cases, staff create data from existing sources and then add required attribution.\n</procdesc>\n        <procdate>2003</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>D.C.

This step involves: 1.) configuring the datasets into a common form; 2.) geocoding tabular data using a common address base;  3.) generating or converting paper documents into digital format; 4.) populating required fields; and 5.) resolving data duplication and conflicts.\n\nFor geocoding, staff use a derivative of the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) owner-point database and the District Department of Transportation's (DDOT) street inventory system (SIS) street centerline file as the address base.  Through automated procedures on the owner-point derivative file, personnel clean and standardize the irregular premise address information into street number, name, type, and quadrant fields.  Also, staff use the merged SIS file containing the five centerlines classifications (street, alley, drive, service road, and ramp).\n\nFirst, staff match tabular data to the standardized owner-points.  Then, the rest are matched to the street centerline file.  After this, staff compose a list of the unmatched records needing further research.  Since not all of the records geocode, staff note the final matching figures (number of hits, rejects, and the total).\n\nFor web links, team members check the validity of existing links and find matching web sites that directly represent the feature.  Staff use several web search engines to find appropriate web links.  DC government sites are primarily used, when available.\n\nTo eliminate data redundancy, staff identify possible conflicting layers and duplicate features.  In some cases, staff pick the best source.  In others, the attributes in the multiple layers are consolidated.  Sometimes, staff map the conflicting layers and investigate feature clusters as areas of potential duplication.\n\nWhere applicable, team members move points to the center of the corresponding buildings.  Staff then select the building footprints and assign the appropriate GIS_ID value that links the points with the appropriate building polygon(s).</procdesc>\n        <procdate>2003</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>D.C.

Various processes check the following parameters: 1.) spatial and attribute accuracy; 2.) data usability; 3.) data dictionary adherence; 4.) specialized metrics, such as connectivity and directionality; and 5.) data load success.  These checks are, as follows:\n\nVisual - staff perform a structured visual check of the data, using on-screen, plotting, and customized routines, and, at times, comparing it to the source documents.\n\nEdge-matching - For grided datasets, staff review the spatial capture, connectivity, and attribution of data across tile boundaries, where applicable.\n\nAutomated - Staff compare the data to documented standards and source files through automated procedures and reports.\n\nSpecialized - Staff review more specific data parameters, such as directionality, connectivity , and topology.\n\nEdit Verification - Staff ensure that previous errors are fixed to specifications.\n·\nField Verification - Occasionally, through field work, team members compare the GIS data with the real world.\n\nData Loading - Staff evaluate the success and evaluate the process of loading raw data into a structured database.\n\nSince most of the data use addresses as the spatial reference, staff compare the data against base layers (buildings, roads, street centerlines, owner-points, parks, and orthophotography) and move features where needed.\n\nIn some cases, OCTO GIS personnel produce maps and reports for source agency review. Through an iterative process, staff modify and enhance the layer to agency specifications.  For some datasets, the agency endorses the final product for data load and publication.\n</procdesc>\n        <procdate>2003</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>D.C.

If not already done, a GIS_ID (unique id for features in the layer) is computed with automated tools.\n</procdesc>\n        <procdate>2003</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>D.C.

Second, personnel register the layer into the appropriate tables and establish the unique feature-ids (the link between the spatial object and its attributes) specific to that layer.  Then, staff populate feature, search, address, web url, contact, data source, and other tables, where applicable. For point layers, team members calculate each feature's geographic extent and populate the features table.  Lastly, each layer is intersected with the base geography (2002 Advisory Neighborhood Commission areas, 2002 wards, zip codes, neighborhoods, and neighborhood clusters) to populate the \"what's-within\" tables for the web reports.  Views are refreshed when needed.\n</procdesc>\n        <procdate>2003</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>D.C.

First, staff compare the test database contents with documented standards.  Then, team members check the geography and attribution, as well as compare dataset parameters between both layers.\n\nThe data team performs attribute checks on the ORACLE database to ensure the existence and validity of views.  Again, staff compare the database contents with documented standards.  For critical views, personnel check the view structures and data against source files and documentation.\n</procdesc>\n        <procdate>2003</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>D.C.

Legacy records were deleted and attribute edits were performed where needed.</procdesc>\n        <procdate>2004</procdate>\n        <proccont>\n          <cntinfo>\n            <cntorgp>\n              <cntorg>OCTO</cntorg>\n            </cntorgp>\n            <cntaddr>\n              <addrtype/>\n              <address/>\n              <city/>\n              <state/>\n              <postal/>\n            </cntaddr>\n            <cntvoice/>\n          </cntinfo>\n        </proccont>\n      </procstep>\n      <procstep>\n        <procdesc>Dataset copied.</procdesc>\n        <srcused>C:\\OCTOGIS\\Data\\OA\\NursingHomePt</srcused>\n        <procdate/>\n      </procstep>\n    </lineage>\n  </dataqual>\n  <spdoinfo>\n    <direct>Vector</direct>\n    <ptvctinf>\n      <sdtsterm>\n        <sdtstype>Entity point</sdtstype>\n        <ptvctcnt>21</ptvctcnt>\n      </sdtsterm>\n    </ptvctinf>\n  </spdoinfo>\n  <spref>\n    <horizsys>\n      <planar>\n        <gridsys>\n          <gridsysn>State Plane Coordinate System 1983</gridsysn>\n          <spcs>\n            <spcszone>1900</spcszone>\n            <lambertc>\n              <stdparll>38.3</stdparll>\n              <stdparll>39.45</stdparll>\n              <longcm>-77.0</longcm>\n              <latprjo>0.0</latprjo>\n              <feast>400000.0</feast>\n              <fnorth>0.0</fnorth>\n            </lambertc>\n          </spcs>\n        </gridsys>\n        <planci>\n          <plance>coordinate pair</plance>\n          <coordrep>\n            <absres>0.6096</absres>\n            <ordres>0.6096</ordres>\n          </coordrep>\n          <plandu>meters</plandu>\n        </planci>\n      </planar>\n      <geodetic>\n        <horizdn>North_American_Datum_1983</horizdn>\n        <ellips>GRS_1980</ellips>\n        <semiaxis>6378137.0</semiaxis>\n        <denflat>298.257222101</denflat>\n      </geodetic>\n    </horizsys>\n  </spref>\n  <eainfo>\n    <detailed>\n      <enttyp>\n        <enttypl>NursingHomePt.shp Attribute Table</enttypl>\n        <enttypd>Table containing attribute information associated with the data set.</enttypd>\n        <enttypds>Producer Defined</enttypds>\n      </enttyp>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>FID</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef>\n        <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n          <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef>Feature geometry.</attrdef>\n        <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n<udom>Coordinates defining the features.</udom>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>ID</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef/>\n        <attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n<rdom>\n            <rdommin>1.0</rdommin>\n            <rdommax>25.0</rdommax>\n          </rdom>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>ADDRESS</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef/>\n        <attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n<udom/>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>ADMINISTRA</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef/>\n        <attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n<udom/>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>NAME</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef/>\n        <attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n<udom/>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n        <attrlabl>BEDS</attrlabl>\n        <attrdef/>\n        <attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs>\n        <attrdomv>\n<rdom>\n            <rdommin>20.0</rdommin>\n            <rdommax>355.0</rdommax>\n          </rdom>\n        </attrdomv>\n      </attr>\n      <attr>\n  <attrlabl>OWNERSHIP</attrlabl>\n<attrdef/>\n<attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs>\n<attrdomv>\n<edom>\n  <edomv>&lt;&lt;
